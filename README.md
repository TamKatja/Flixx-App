# Flixx App

Vanilla JavaScript movie/TV-show listing UI from my [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning course](https://www.traversymedia.com/). Implements search, pagination and custom router features. Built using [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) public API. _Note: API key is not hidden as keys are freely available and this is not a production-level application._

This project was created to practice JavaScript asynchronous programming and working with the fetch API.
